# Golang-Vagrant

This is a vagrant repository to make it easy to compile Go on Linux (Debian/Stretch).
If Vagrant is already installed the following should bring up a Vagrant instance,
compile Go 1.4.3 and 1.10.


```shell
    vagrant up
```

Then follow the steps in [Final-Steps.md](Final-Steps.md)
